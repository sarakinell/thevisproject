Check out my GitHub Pages and tick the 'Home" button to get started. You may enter the different blog posts by clicking on their interactive graphics. The navigation helps you to find the Home page (also via the logo in the top left corner), the Blog page (where all posts are listed), and the About page with general information as well as a contact form at the very bottom. Thank you for your time in browsing through my very first website project!

## Course in Webdevelopment

Since the course in Web Engineering at ETH Zürich after Spring 2017 no longer takes place, I was delighted to find the course in Webentwicklung für Datenjournalisten at the University of Zürich.

This hands-on, project-based course is centered around the challenge of creating a responsive website with interactive graphics. Nowadays, it is certainly important with responsiveness due to the increasingly large usage of mobile devices and all kinds of screen sizes, but also because of Search Engine Optimization and the decreased chances of being found on the world wide web when not providing an adaptive website.

When you run create-react-app, it always creates the project with the latest version of react-scripts so you’ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.
