## Course in Webdevelopment

Since the course in [Web Engineering](https://globis.ethz.ch/#!/course/web-engineering-2017/) at ETH Zürich after Spring 2017 no longer takes place, I was delighted to find the course in [Webentwicklung für Datenjournalisten](https://lms.uzh.ch/olat/dmz/) at the University of Zürich.

This hands-on, project-based course is centered around the challenge of creating a **responsive website with interactive graphics**. Nowadays, it is certainly important with responsiveness, due to the increasingly large usage of mobile devices and all kinds of screen sizes, but _also_ because of Search Engine Optimization and the decreased chances of being [found on the world wide web](https://moz.com/blog/mobile-first-indexing-seo) when not providing an adaptive website.

## Technologies used

I focused on using technologies that would fulfil the project purpose of creating a responsive website with interactive graphics. All are based on the different components treated as part of the [course program](#course-program).

### React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a component-based JavaScript library, well suited for interactive websites. As soon as data changes in the application, the interface is efficiently rendered. What's more, [getting started](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) with React is quick _and_ easy.

### Nivo

[Nivo](http://nivo.rocks/) is built for [React](#react) _and_ upon the D3 library treated in the course. It provides server side rendering and beautiful charts.

### Firebase
### REST API
### CSS Flexbox
