              The latest official, political gallup poll was carried out in May,
              2018. The Swedish Social Democratic Party, S, received the
              strongest support, followed by the Moderate Party, M, and the
              Sweden Democrats, SD. The question answered by the survey
              participants was "How would you vote if the election was today?".

              is an ideology for national promotion, in everything related to

              may, for example, believe that citizenship should be limited to
              one ethnic. Historically, nationalists have often received
              increased support when people perceive an inconsistency between
              their own definition of social order and the environment they
              experience.<br />
